The program of accounting of details of scaffolding in the warehouse

The program displays the quantity of each part in stock and on construction sites. Using the program, you can enter information about sending scaffolding to construction sites and returning them to the warehouse. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Database schema for the application:
